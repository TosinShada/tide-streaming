   This runs `./initialize.sh futurenet` behind the scenes, which will create a `token-admin` identity for you (`soroban config identity create token-admin`) and deploy a Fungible Token contract as well as the [payment stream contract](./contracts/stream), with this account as admin.

2. Select the Futurenet network in your Freighter browser extension
